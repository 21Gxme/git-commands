#### Note on Paths

In this file, directory paths are written with a forward slash as on MacOS, Linux, and the Windows-Bash shell: `/dir1/dir2/somefile`.    


## Basics

1. When using Git locally, what are these?  Define each one in a sentence
   * Staging area - Where prepare and organize changes before committing them to the repository.
   * Working copy - The local directory when edit and modify files before staging and committing them
   * master - The default and main branch of a Git repository.
   * HEAD - A pointer that indicates the latest commit in the branch

2. When you install git on a new machine (or in a new user account) you should perform these 2 git commands to tell git your name and email.  These values are used in commits that you make:
   ```
   # Git configuration commands for a new account
    git config --global user.name "Tantikon Phasanphaengsi"
    git config --global user.email "tantikon.p@ku.th"

   ```

3. There are 2 ways to create a local Git repository.  Briefly descibe each one:
    - git init : initialize a new Git repository in an existing directory
    - git clone : create a local copy of an existing remote repository 


## Adding and Changing Things

Suppose your working copy of a repository contains these files and directories:
```
README.md
out/
    a.exe
src/a.py
    b.py
    c.py
test/
    test_a.py
    ...
```

1. Add README.md and *everything* in the `src` directory to the git staging area.
   ```
   git add README.md src/
   ```

2. Add `test/test_a.py` to the staging area (but not any other files).
   ```
   git add test/test_a.py
   ```

3. List the names of files in the staging area.
   ```
   git status
   ```

4. Remove `README.md` from the staging area. This is **very useful** if you accidentally add something you don't want to commit.
   ```
   git reset README.md
   ```

5. Commit everything in the staging area to the repository.
   ```
   git commit -m "commit message"
   ```

6. In any project, there are some files and directories that you **should not** commit to git.    
   For a Python project, name *at least* files or directories that you should not commit to git:
   - venv
   - pycache
   - Sensitive or Private Information


7. Command to move all the .py files from the `src` dir to the top-level directory of this repository. This command moves them in your working copy *and* in the git repo (when you commit the change):
   ```  
   git mv src/*.py .
   ```


8. In this repository, create your own `.gitignore` file that you can reuse in other Python projects.  Add everything that you think is relevant.    
   *Hint:* A good place to start is to create a new repo on Github and during the creation dialog, ask Github to make a .gitignore for Python projects. Then edit it.  Don't forget to include pytest output and MacOS junk.



## Undo Changes and Recover Files


1.  Display the differences between your *working copy* of `a.py` and the `a.py` in the *local repository* (HEAD revision):
   ```
   git diff a.py
   ```

2. Display the differences between your *working copy* of `a.py` and the version in the *staging area*. (But, if a.py is not in the staging area this will compare working copy to HEAD revision):
    ```
    git diff --staged a.py
    ```

3. **View changes to be committed:** Display the differences between files in the staging area and the versions in the repository. (You can also specify a file name to compare just one file.) 
    ```
    git diff --staged
    ```

4. **Undo "git add":** If `main.py` has been added to the staging area (`git add main.py`), remove it from the staging area:
   ```
   git reset main.py
   ```

5. **Recover a file:** Command to replace your working copy of `a.py` with the most recent (HEAD) version in the repository.  This also works if you have deleted your working copy of this file.
   ```
   git checkout a.py
   `````

6. **Undo a commit:** Suppose you want to discard some commit(s) and move both HEAD and "master" to an earlier revision (an earlier commit)  Suppose the git commit graph looks like this (`aaaa`, etc, are the commit ids)
   ```
   aaaa ---> bbbb ---> cccc ---> dddd [HEAD -> master]
   ``` 
   The command to reset HEAD and master to the commit id `bbbb`:
   ```
   git reset --hard bbbb
   ```


7. **Checkout old code:** Using the above example, the command to replace your working copy with the files from commit with id `aaaa`:
   ```
    git checkout aaaa
    ```
   ```
    Note:
    - Git won't let you do this if you have uncommitted changes to any "tracked" files.
    - Untracked files are ignored, so after doing this command they will still be in your working copy.
 

## Viewing Commits

1. Show the history of commits, using one line per commit:
   ```
   git log --oneline
   ```
   Some versions of git have an *alias* "log1" for this (`git log1`).

2. Show the history (as above) including *all* branches in the repository and include a graph connecting the commits:
   ```
    git log --oneline --graph --all --decorate
   ```


3. List all the files in the current branch of the repository:
   ```
   git ls-tree -r HEAD --name-only
   ```
   Example output:
   ```
   .gitignore
   README.md
   a.py
   b.py
   test/test_a.py
   test/test_b.py
   ```


## Branch and Merge
1. Create a new branch named `test-dev` and switch to it:
   ```
   git checkout -b test-dev
   ```
   
2. List all the branches in the repository:
   ```
    git branch
   ```

3. Switch to the `master` branch:
   ```
    git checkout master
   ```
   
4. Merge the `test-dev` branch into the `master` branch:
   ```
    git merge test-dev
   ```

## Favorites

- This is a common task when working on a new feature or bug fix. It empowers developers to work collaboratively, and maintain a well-organized version history.
    ```
    git checkout -b new-feature
    ```
